# Arcana

Arcana is an Arch Linux automation project focused on fast, reproducible, and fully scripted installations. It is built around ALIS (Arch Linux Install Scripts), enabling unattended or minimal-interaction installs using predefined configuration files.

Arcana provides custom Arch-based ISO images built with archiso, allowing users to install complete systems in a very short time. The project emphasizes speed, consistency, and flexibility, making it suitable for both personal use and larger deployments.

Users can clone, modify, and extend the Arcana scripts to suit their own needs, including selecting different desktop environments such as XFCE, GNOME, Plasma, or window managers like BSPWM. The approach is modular and transparent, keeping close alignment with upstream Arch Linux.

Overall, Arcana targets Arch users who want automation without abstraction, offering a practical solution for rapid system deployment, testing, education, and reproducible Linux setups.

# Finishing touch

After the installation of Arcana we run scripts like 

arcolinux-nemesis

from

https://github.com/erikdubois/arcolinux-nemesis

and/or

scripts from 

https://github.com/kirodubes/kiro-nemesis

or you create your own scripts to install all the software and configs for them.

I want Xfce4 and Chadwm as my base of operations.
